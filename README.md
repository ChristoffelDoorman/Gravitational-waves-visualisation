# GW-visualisation

Requirements:

* Python version      :  3.7.0 (may work on other versions but has not been tested) 
* Bokeh version       :  0.13.0

To run the application, open a command prompt, change to the directory containing bokeh_app and run `python main.py`. This runs a bokeh server locally and will automatically open the interactive dashboard in your browser at localhost:5006.

You can download the directory by downloading the zip file.
